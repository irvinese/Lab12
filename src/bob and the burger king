one day bob was walking down the street when bob, the burger king, invaded my home.
he eat all the burgers and then left, so mean.
Bob was sad, not the king bob, the regualr bob who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It's clear that storytelling is not my forte so I'm gonna stop here cus I think this is good enough for a text file.
